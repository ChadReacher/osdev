I have encounterd an interesting bug.
You run the OS, enter the shell and you just exit from it by typing `exit` command.
Then, you run the OS again and it fails to grab necessary data from disk.
By comparing the disk images before the first boot and after the first boot we observe the differences.
Specifically, somehow data blocks reserved for filesystem info are overwritten by the kernel code.
The main suspect is `buffer cache code`. The function `sync_buffers` are called on the `init` process exit.
The reason of the bug lies within ATA driver code - we apparently need to wait a little bit after performing 'write' operation.
This forum discussion saved me - https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24394.

Bugs:
* ./test searches the binary executable in PATH. It finds and executes this file
* test program behaves strange. When stopping the program and then resuming it, the counter starts just 1 number above. For example, we stopped at 3, and it started at 5
* Ctrl+D does not work
